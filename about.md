Hello, hello! My name is Oskar, and I am a computer programmer. From a very young age I've always had tech exposure. My father had a big open office which looking back, gave me access to an otherwise hard to come by plethora of ancient and modern items. I'd play with the printer all day long and occasionally reverse the direction of the mouse and spend the next hour or so trying to think backwards to correct it. 

There is no real goal or direction of the blog as such, but it serves more or less an outlet for me to discuss and make sense of particular thoughts I've been having. As should be the norm, the thoughts and views expressed in my writings are of my own, not some other third party.
