Dear reader,

So this is the first and hopefully not the last blog entry on my site. Since I have a habit of starting and stopping almost everything I do, you may not hear from me for a long time. If not the case, then you should be surprised.

As it currently stands, I'm a software engineering student studying in Melbourne, Victoria. I am aiming to graduate by mid-way through the year 2023. Since the COVID-19 Scenario in which I find myself, uni, and life has been pretty strange. Work has been less frequent, but thanks to scomo I'll survive, bless you Centrelink you beautiful bastard.

Over the past few weeks, I've started to grow accustom to staying home more often. I'm more prompt in attending to life admin, such as reorgansing my room. Currently at Mk42 if you're interested, I know my roommates are.. (sorry). And I've actually made some sort of effort to wash my sheets. Who knew that once a moon phase wasn't enough.

Over the next two weeks I'll be finishing up semester one of uni and getting onto more personal projects as well as ideally, more blogging. Until then, good day!

Regards, Oskar
